Keratoconus, a progressive eye disorder, can lead to vision impairment if not detected early. Leveraging machine learning
algorithms, this study analyzes corneal data obtained through advanced imaging techniques. The proposed model identifies intricate
corneal patterns that are indicative of keratoconus, enabling accurate and timely diagnosis. Moreover, the system offers continuous
monitoring, personalized risk assessment, and real-time telemedicine accessibility. The integration of machine learning holds the
potential to revolutionize early keratoconus detection, enhancing patient care and advancing ophthalmic research.
